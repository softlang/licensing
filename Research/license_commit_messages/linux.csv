linux,"cpufreq: arm_big_little: fix module license spec Having no license specification in a module taints the kernel during load with: arm_big_little: module license 'unspecified' taints kernel. and also the linker doesn't allow it to make use of GPL-exported symbols which in this case also results in errors like: arm_big_little: Unknown symbol cpufreq_register_driver (err 0) . The header of the driver specifies a GPL v2 license, so note that accordingly. While at it also add a description and an author and fix the license in a companion file to explicit v2.

linux,"cpufreq / governor: Fix problem with cpufreq_ondemand or cpufreq_conservative Since commit 2aacdff entitled ""cpufreq: Move common part from governors to separate file"", whenever the drivers that depend on this new file (cpufreq_ondemand or cpufreq_conservative) are built as modules, a new module named cpufreq_governor is created because the Makefile includes cpufreq_governor.o twice. As drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_governor.c contains no MODULE directives, the resulting module has no license specified, which results in logging of a ""module license 'unspecified' taints kernel"". In addition, a number of globals are exported GPL only, and are therefore not available. This fix establishes a new boolean configuration variable that forces cpufreq_governor.o to be linked into the kernel whenever either cpufreq_ondemand or cpufreq_conservative is selected.
