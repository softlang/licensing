docker,"Update README.md added Licensing Docker is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See LICENSE for full license text."
docker,"Add Developer Certificate of Origin Text We purposely chose to license Docker under the Apache 2.0 license. This is a well-known license, which is popular for its permissive and flexible properties, while still encouraging a collaborative community. It also makes certain representations with regard to contributions, and the rights given to contributors, the project, people who use Docker, people who modify Docker, etc. This approach to contributions is inspired by the popular Linux Developer ""Certificate of Origin"". This approach makes it simple for new contributors to get started, and avoids bureaucracy in tracking contributions and contributors. To indicate accordance, each individual contribution to the Project is signed off by the developer, using his or her real name, email address, and github handle in the format below: Docker-DCO-1.0-Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>"
docker,"Add quick_docker.html Docker Quick Reference page This is an initial version of a summary page for intermediate and advanced docker users. It is developed from github.com/merriam/quick_reference and the guide is under a CC Share-a-like Non-commercial license. It's still improviing, but provides some quick help so far."
